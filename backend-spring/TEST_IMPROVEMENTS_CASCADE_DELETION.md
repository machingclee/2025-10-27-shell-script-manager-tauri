1. ✅ Remove `entityManager.flush()` (unnecessary with `@Transactional`)
2. ✅ Remove setup assertions from Arrange section
3. ✅ Add assertion messages for clarity
4. ✅ Verify event payloads, not just count
5. ✅ Better variable naming

The improved version is cleaner, more focused, and easier to debug when it fails! 🎯
