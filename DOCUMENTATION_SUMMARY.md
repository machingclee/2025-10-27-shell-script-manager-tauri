# 📚 Documentation Organization Complete!

All Spring Boot backend documentation has been organized into the **`docs/`** folder with numbered prefixes for easy reading.

---

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. Created Documentation Folder

All markdown files have been moved to **`docs/`** and numbered 0-6 for reading order.

### 2. File Organization

**Before** (scattered files):
```
.
├── START_HERE.md
├── SPRING_BACKEND_OVERVIEW.md
├── SPRING_BACKEND_SETUP.md
└── backend-spring/
    ├── QUICK_START.md
    ├── FLYWAY_WORKFLOW.md
    └── RUST_INTEGRATION_EXAMPLE.md
```

**After** (organized in docs/):
```
.
├── README_SPRING_BACKEND.md          ← Quick reference
│
├── docs/                             ← All documentation
│   ├── README.md                     ← Documentation index
│   ├── 0_READ_ME_FIRST.md           ← Reading guide ⭐ START HERE
│   ├── 1_START_HERE.md              ← Quick orientation
│   ├── 2_OVERVIEW.md                ← Overview & concepts
│   ├── 3_COMPLETE_SETUP_GUIDE.md    ← Complete setup (31 sections)
│   ├── 4_QUICK_START.md             ← Quick reference
│   ├── 5_FLYWAY_WORKFLOW.md         ← Database migrations
│   └── 6_RUST_INTEGRATION.md        ← Rust/Tauri integration
│
└── backend-spring/                   ← Spring Boot project
    ├── src/                          ← Source code
    └── README.md                     ← Project README (updated)
```

### 3. Numbered Prefixes

Files are prefixed with numbers **0-6** indicating the recommended reading order:

- **0** = Reading guide (start here!)
- **1** = Quick orientation
- **2** = Overview
- **3** = Complete guide
- **4** = Quick reference
- **5** = Migrations workflow
- **6** = Rust integration

### 4. Cross-References Updated

All internal links between documents have been updated to use the new file locations and names.

### 5. Entry Points Created

Multiple entry points for different use cases:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **README_SPRING_BACKEND.md** (root) | Quick overview + links to docs |
| **docs/README.md** | Full documentation index |
| **docs/0_READ_ME_FIRST.md** | Reading guide with progress tracker |
| **backend-spring/README.md** | Project README (updated links) |
